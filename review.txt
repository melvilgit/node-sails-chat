Worked with sails.js tutorial page.
Followed each instruction in the webpage,installed the node packages such as sails.js,password-hasher etc
Great Tutorial !! Sails.js is an awesome framework that supports realtime socket connection.
I followed each step but i got a lots of issues,i went throught the original github profile and made some changes to my original directory from there.

I am able to understand how the sails.js framework works.I really wonders how easily it implemented a chat feauture :-)
but i think i need to study more about the BackBone.js code in chat.ejs file in views directory.From the original code i just added an extra bootstrap.css for ui.Wishes to learn more awesome frameworks like sails.js :-).
